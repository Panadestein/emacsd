#+title: Emacs config
#+author: Panadestein

This is my =$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el=. I have a very basic config,
fine tuned for Python, C and FORTRAN development. I use =use-package=
throughout the file, to make it portable for future installs.

* Useful tweaks

I use Emacs in an *Arch Linux* box, with *Gnome* as desktop environment. I think the
systemd unit is the way to go here. It speeds up the startup process as the heavy config
file is uploaded only once. A very good explanation can be found [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Emacs#Running_Emacs][here]]. After editing 
the config file, the unit must be reloaded:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  systemctl --user restart emacs
  #+END_SRC

To use =emacsclient= with the GUI application,
the file =~/.local/share/applications/emacsclient.desktop= must be created with 
the following content:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  [Desktop Entry]
Name=Emacs (Client)
GenericName=Text Editor
Comment=Edit text
MimeType=text/english;text/plain;text/x-makefile;text/x-c++hdr;text/x-c++src;text/x-chdr;text/x-csrc;text/x-java;text/x-moc;text/x-pascal;text/x-tcl;text/x-tex;application/x-shellscript;text/x-c;text/x-c++;
Exec=emacsclient -—Å -a "emacs" %F
Icon=emacs
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Categories=Development;TextEditor;Utility;
StartupWMClass=Emacs
  #+END_SRC
