* Simple Emacs config

  This is my =$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el=. I have a very basic config,
  fine tuned for Python, C and FORTRAN development. It can be extended /ad infinitum/,
  as usual in Emacs (see for instance [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WhyUseEmacs][this]]).

* Useful tweaks

  I use Emacs in an *Arch Linux* box, with *Gnome* as desktop environment. I think the
  systemd unit is the way to go here. It speeds up the startup process af the heavy config
  file is uploaded only once. A very good explanation can be found [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Emacs#Running_Emacs][here]]. After editing 
  the config file, the unit must be reloaded:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  systemctl --user restart emacs
  #+END_SRC
