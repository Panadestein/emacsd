This is my [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] Emacs configuration. It was initially fine-tuned for Python,
C, C++, FORTRAN and Lisp development, but it has grown far beyond the initial scope.
I use =use-package= extensively, which ensures a reproducible configuration.

* Useful tweaks

I use Emacs mainly on [[https://github.com/Panadestein/nixos-config][NixOS]], with *Qtile* as desktop environment. I like to use the
=systemd= unit of =emacsclient=. It speeds up the startup process as the heavy config
file is uploaded only once. A very good explanation can be found [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Emacs#Running_Emacs][here]]. After editing 
the config file, the unit must be reloaded:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  systemctl --user restart emacs
#+END_SRC

To use =emacsclient= with the GUI application,
the file =~/.local/share/applications/emacsclient.desktop= must be created with 
the following content:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=Emacs (Client)
  GenericName=Text Editor
  Comment=Edit text
  MimeType=text/english;text/plain;text/x-makefile;text/x-c++hdr;text/x-c++src;text/x-chdr;text/x-csrc;text/x-java;text/x-moc;text/x-pascal;text/x-tcl;text/x-tex;application/x-shellscript;text/x-c;text/x-c++;
  Exec=emacsclient -—Å -a "emacs" %F
  Icon=emacs
  Type=Application
  Terminal=false
  Categories=Development;TextEditor;Utility;
  StartupWMClass=Emacs
#+END_SRC
