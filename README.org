#+title: Literate Emacs configuration
#+author: Panadestein

This is my [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] Emacs configuration. It was initially fine tuned for Python,
C, FORTRAN and Lisp development, but it has grown far beyond the initial scope.
I use =use-package= extensively, which ensures a reproducible configuration.

* Useful tweaks

I use Emacs mainly in an *Arch Linux* box, with *Gnome* as desktop environment. I like to use the
systemd unit of emacsclient. It speeds up the startup process as the heavy config
file is uploaded only once. A very good explanation can be found [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Emacs#Running_Emacs][here]]. After editing 
the config file, the unit must be reloaded:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  systemctl --user restart emacs
  #+END_SRC

To use =emacsclient= with the GUI application,
the file =~/.local/share/applications/emacsclient.desktop= must be created with 
the following content:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  [Desktop Entry]
Name=Emacs (Client)
GenericName=Text Editor
Comment=Edit text
MimeType=text/english;text/plain;text/x-makefile;text/x-c++hdr;text/x-c++src;text/x-chdr;text/x-csrc;text/x-java;text/x-moc;text/x-pascal;text/x-tcl;text/x-tex;application/x-shellscript;text/x-c;text/x-c++;
Exec=emacsclient -—Å -a "emacs" %F
Icon=emacs

Terminal=false

  #+END_SRC
